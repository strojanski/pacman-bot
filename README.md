# Pacman Agent

A template for coding a pacman agent.

## Setting up the environment
1. Copy or clone the code from this framework to create your Pacman Agent, e.g., `git clone git@github.com:jsego/pacman-agent.git`
2. Go into pacman-agent folder, `cd pacman-agent/`
3. Run `git submodule update --init --remote` to pull the last pacman-contest
4. Create a virtual environment, e.g., `python3.8 -m venv venv`
5. Activate the virtual environment with `source venv/bin/activate`
6. Go to the pacman-contest folder and install the requirements:
    - `cd pacman-contest/`
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - `pip install -e .`

## Coding a new agent
In the root folder do the following:
1. Create in `myTeam.py` a class with the name of your agent that inherits from `CaptureAgent`, e.g. `class ReflexCaptureAgent(CaptureAgent):`
2. In the new class, override the `def choose_action(self, game_state):` function to return the best next action (check the given source code example).
3. (Optional) Add any other functions to the class for reasoning / learning and improving your agents decision which could also use other code sources in the same folder.

To debug the agent you can run `capture.py` between the `baselineTeam` and your current agent:
1. `cd pacman-contest/src/contest/`
2. `python capture.py -r baselineTeam -b ../../../myTeam.py`
